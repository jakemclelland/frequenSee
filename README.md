Most "top 800 most common words" list I've ever seen for any language learners were based on the work that a guy did back in the 1960's in England. But English has changed a lot since then, and much of the world has their own culturally / regionally unique flavor of English that make most lists of common words not only antiquated, but flat out useless. For example, nobody in Armenia has ever used "Jam" on "Toast" (except for maybe me). So why in the world did anyone bother to translate those words into Armenian, much less place them on some so-called list of suposedly "most common" words you should learn in Armenian? 

The bigger, and more real challenge to a non-native language learner is the fact that the language you use at home is often vastly different than the language you use at work, which is different than the language you hear on the news. So the top 100 most common words one might use at home might not really get you very far at work. 

The purpose of this project is to allow you to paste some text in and find out from that sample the top most frequently used words and characters.
