Many of the "most common words" list I've ever seen for language learners were based largely on works such as [the Brown Corpus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_Corpus) research study compiled in the late 1960's at the Brown University in Providence Rhode Island. But English has changed a lot since then, and much of the world has their own culturally / regionally unique flavor of English that make most lists of common words not only antiquated, but sometimes useless or even wasteful. For example, I can't remember the last time I used the word "parcel" in a sentence in English, but there it is on the list of 800 supposedly most common words in Armenian ("ծանրոց"). Another similar list for Hindi shows the English word "carraige" translated as "गाडी", but this word really means "vehicle". I only would ever think of a baby carraige. I've never once called any kind of vehicle a carraige. The problem with most "common words" lists, is that they start in the learner's own language. But just because a word is common in the learner's language doesn't mean the same concept will be common in the target language. So, why in the world should anyone bother to translate these words, much less place them on some so-called list of suposedly "most common" words a learner should spend precious time learning? 

The bigger, and more real challenge to a non-native language learner is the fact that the vocabulary used at home (informal and usually intimate and familial) (like "hey hun, pass the butter!") is often vastly different than the vocabulary used at the workplace (more formal and professional) ("John, the server just went down again, could you reboot it?"), which is still very different than the vocabulary you hear on the news ("Man caught smuggling drugs through airport security") So the top 100 most common words used at home might not really get you very far at work, or in a public setting. You may not really care about learning vocabulary of all the different body parts, unless you plan on working in the medical field, for example, and you may never hear important workplace vocabulary while listening to the news. So, why not target vocabulary learning to the most urgent and specific type of setting that YOU will mostly likely find yourself in? Even more to the point, the most practical list of words will most certainly change over time as you become more fluent, and people start expecting more vocabulary from you. In other words, even the most modern generic list of 1000 words will almost certainly contain only a fraction of the words you really need, and yet be filled with tons of words you may never realistically need.

The purpose of this project is to allow you to paste some text in and find out from that sample the top most frequently used words and characters. The more text entered, the more accurate the statistics provided. If you can collect and enter text that is more specific to the setting you're interested in, be it a household setting, proffessional, technical, or a public forum setting, the more relavant the statistics are to the words you need to learn.
